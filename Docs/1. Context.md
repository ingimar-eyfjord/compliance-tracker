Awesome—this is a great way to learn Laravel in a context that maps to Formalize. I’ll do three things:

1. decode what you’ve already set up,
2. summarize what Formalize offers + how they likely run it (with sources),
3. give you a concrete build plan to mimic it in Laravel (with optional Angular alignment).

---

# 1) What you’ve set up

From your files you’ve created a **Laravel 12** app with a **React + Inertia** front-end, Tailwind v4, and shadcn-style component aliases.

* **composer.json**

  * Core: `laravel/framework:^12`, `inertiajs/inertia-laravel:^2.0`.
  * Auth hardening: `laravel/fortify` (API-first auth).
  * Dev DX: `sail`, `pint`, `pail`, `phpunit`, `collision`.
  * Scripts:

    * `setup` = install → copy `.env` → keygen → migrate → npm install → build.
    * `dev` / `dev:ssr` = runs **php artisan serve**, queues, logs (**pail**), and **Vite** (plus SSR with `inertia:start-ssr`).
* **package.json**

  * Tooling: Vite 7, TypeScript 5, ESLint 9, Prettier 3.
  * UI: `@inertiajs/react`, Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), Radix primitives, lucide-react, shadcn conventions (`class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`).
* **component.json (shadcn)**

  * New York style theme, React (tsx), Tailwind v4 vars, path aliases (`@/components`, `@/lib`, etc.).

✅ Bottom line: you’ve got a modern **Laravel API + React (Inertia) SPA** baseline that’s perfect for a modular, multi-feature compliance tool.

# 2) What Formalize does (and likely how)

## Products & scope

* **Formalize** markets a broader **compliance platform** (NIS2, DORA, risk, audit, etc.) with their whistleblowing product as a core component (“Whistleblower Software by Formalize”). ([formalize.com][1])
* Their site positions the platform as **interlinked features** with **customisation**, suggesting a modular product strategy where customers can expand over time. Pricing page emphasizes a platform you can “grow with.” ([formalize.com][2])
* The **Whistleblower Software** product itself highlights **end-to-end encryption**, GDPR, ISO/ISAE audits, multi-language, two-way comms, and enterprise scale (50–10,000+). ([whistleblowersoftware.com][3])

## Security & hosting hints

* Their **security page** explicitly states **E2E encryption** done client-side with decryption in the browser; data stored in **AWS**. That implies strong crypto boundaries and careful key handling on the client. ([whistleblowersoftware.com][4])

## Tech stack signals

* Historic and current job ads list: **Angular + NgRx + Tailwind** on the front end; **Laravel** on the back end; **AWS** infra; **E2E encryption**. That aligns with a Laravel API + SPA model. ([The Hub][5])
* Current career page confirms the **Software Engineer** role and scale-up context. ([Formalize][6])

## Likely architectural approach (inference, based on above)

* **Modular / multi-product** SaaS with shared primitives (Org / Users / Roles / Audit Trail) and **feature modules** (Whistleblowing, Risk, Audit, etc.), matching their “interlinked features” messaging. (Inference from product & pricing pages.) ([formalize.com][2])
* **Laravel API** (REST/JSON) + **Angular SPA** with **NgRx** for global state and E2E crypto implemented **client-side** for whistleblowing flows. (Inference grounded in job-stack pages + security page.) ([The Hub][5])
* **AWS** as the platform (RDS/Aurora for Postgres, S3 for assets, CloudFront, SQS for queues, ElastiCache/Redis). If they lean “serverless,” Laravel can be deployed that way, e.g., the AWS serverless Laravel pattern. (This part is architectural best-practice suggestion, not a claim about their exact setup.) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][7])

---

# 3) Your build plan to mimic Formalize (Laravel-first, Angular-optional)

I’ll give you a **Laravel-first** plan (works with your current Inertia React), then an **Angular alignment** option if you want to mirror their FE stack later.

## A. Domain & data design (DDD-lite)

Create bounded contexts (modules) that can be enabled independently:

1. **Core**: Organizations, Users, Roles/Permissions, Teams, Invitations, Settings, API tokens, Audit Trail.
2. **Whistleblowing**: Secure Reports, Channels (public report forms), Participants, Case Management, Messaging/Attachments, Deadlines/SLAs, Actions.
3. **Risk**: Risks, Controls, Assessments, Inherent/Residual scoring, Mitigations, Owners, Evidence.
4. **Audit**: Audits, Findings, CAPAs, Schedules, Evidence links.
5. **Compliance Data**: Policies, Assets/Systems, Regulations/Articles, Mappings, Tasks.

Use **PostgreSQL** (constraints + JSONB for flexible fields) and **Redis** for queues/cache—both match their listed stack. ([The Hub][5])

**Packages to consider**

* Auth & permissions: `laravel/fortify` (already), `spatie/laravel-permission`.
* Multi-tenancy (org-level data separation): `stancl/tenancy` (subdomains or org_id scoping).
* Search: `laravel/scout` + Meilisearch/Algolia.
* File storage: S3 via Laravel Filesystem.
* Queues/events: SQS (or Redis during dev).
* Audit trail: custom table + model events; or `owen-it/laravel-auditing`.

## B. E2E encryption for whistleblowing

Mirror their approach by doing **client-side crypto**:

* Use **WebCrypto** in the SPA to generate an org-specific public key for report intake; store **only ciphertext** server-side.
* For “two-way communication,” encrypt messages with the case’s key; recipients decrypt in browser after authenticating.
* Keep decryption keys out of server DB; derive/unwrap in client (e.g., passphrase + org key escrow model).
* Threat model: server compromise shouldn’t reveal report content.
  Reference: Their page states E2E with browser-side decryption and AWS storage—replicate that pattern. ([whistleblowersoftware.com][4])

## C. API design

* **Authentication**: Fortify + Sanctum for SPA session tokens (or JWT if you make a standalone Angular app).
* **Resources**:

  * `/api/orgs/*`, `/api/users/*`, `/api/roles/*`
  * `/api/channels/*` (public endpoints rate-limited; accept encrypted payload)
  * `/api/cases/*`, `/api/cases/{id}/messages`
  * `/api/risk/*`, `/api/audit/*`, `/api/policies/*`
* **Policies/Authorization**: per-org, role-based + resource ownership.

## D. Front end options

### Option 1 — **Keep Inertia React (fastest)**

* Use your current React + shadcn stack.
* Add a **Public Report Form** route with client-side encryption.
* Add **Case Manager** UI (inbox, filters, timelines, attachments, secure chat).
* Add a minimal **Risk** module (risk register, CRUD, heatmap).

### Option 2 — **Align with Formalize (Angular + NgRx)**

* Scaffold a separate Angular workspace (monorepo or separate repo).
* Auth with **Sanctum** (via cookie) or **JWT** if fully decoupled.
* **NgRx** for global state (org, user, feature flags, cases, risks).
* Component libs: **Tailwind + Headless UI for Angular equivalents** or Angular CDK; icons via lucide/angular.
* Keep E2E crypto in an Angular **CryptoService** wrapping WebCrypto.

(Their stack mentions Angular + NgRx + Tailwind, so Option 2 mirrors them closely.) ([The Hub][5])

## E. Tenanting & feature flags

* Start with **single-tenant** (org_id scoping), then graduate to `stancl/tenancy` for subdomain routing like `acme.localhost`.
* Add **feature flags** to simulate “add-ons”: `core_features` table (org_id, feature, plan_tier, enabled_at). The UI should surface locked features with CTA (mimics “grow with the platform”). (This echoes their “grow with” and “interlinked features” messaging.) ([formalize.com][2])

## F. Observability & compliance

* **Logs/metrics**: Laravel Telescope (dev), CloudWatch in prod; request IDs and structured logging.
* **Audits**: persist **who/what/when** for all mutations; exportable audit trail.
* **Background jobs**: notifications, deadline reminders, digest emails.
* **i18n**: Laravel translations + front-end i18n; mock 12+ languages to mirror their global claim. ([formalize.com][8])

## G. Deployment blueprint (AWS)

* **DB**: RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL (aligns with “PostgreSQL + AWS” direction). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][9])
* **Cache/Queue**: ElastiCache Redis + SQS.
* **Storage/CDN**: S3 + CloudFront.
* **Runtime**:

  * EITHER **ECS Fargate** / EC2 AutoScaling,
  * OR **Serverless** with Laravel on Lambda (e.g., SAM/Bref pattern), which AWS has documented as a viable route for Laravel. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][7])
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → build & test → deploy infra (IaC) → blue/green.

## H. Milestones (ordered to ship value fast)

1. **Core auth & orgs**: Fortify, Org/User/Role CRUD, org scoping, seeds.
2. **Public Channel + E2E Intake**: public route + client crypto; store encrypted report.
3. **Case Manager**: list, assign, status changes, encrypted messaging, attachments.
4. **Risk Lite**: risk register, scoring, filters.
5. **Feature Flags & Plans**: toggle Risk module per org; “upgrade” CTA.
6. **Observability & Audit Trail**: full audit on case changes; exports.
7. **Hardening & i18n**: rate limits, content security headers, 3–5 languages.
8. **Cloud deploy**: move to AWS, queues, S3, CDN.

## Quick answers to your side questions

* **“Do you know exactly how I put up my Laravel project?”**
  Yes: it’s a **Laravel 12** + **Inertia React** app with Tailwind v4 and shadcn-style component scaffolding, wired with **Vite** and handy DX scripts (`dev`, `dev:ssr`, `setup`). Auth uses **Fortify**; background jobs are already integrated via `queue:listen`; logs via **Pail**; SSR via `inertia:start-ssr`. Your front end stack is React-oriented (not Angular), but you can switch to Angular later if you want to mirror Formalize more closely.

* **“Does Formalize sell add-ons and pay-as-you-go?”**
  They present the platform as **modular and interlinked** and something you can “grow with”; detailed public pricing/add-on SKUs aren’t fully spelled out beyond the Whistleblower pricing page. So we’ll **mimic** that model via feature flags and tiered plans in your build. ([formalize.com][2])

## Want me to start by scaffolding the first two modules (Core + Whistleblowing) and the E2E intake flow in Laravel with example models/migrations/routes and a minimal React page that does browser-side encryption? I can drop in the code and you can run it with your existing `setup` script.
